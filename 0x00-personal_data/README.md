# Personal data

Personally identifiable information (PII) and personal data cover information that could directly or indirectly reveal an individualâ€™s identity.
PII can be divided into a few categories, the most common of which are linked (e.g. name, SSN) and linkable (e.g. job position, non-specific age) information. Other types of PII include sensitive and non-sensitive PII.
Personal data includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable person, including online identifiers like cookies and IP addresses.
